    | Verifying an Email Address by Code

    | be guessed; a six digit code can be, so these numbers are what make it
    | safe rather than merely convenient.
    |
    | `expire` is in minutes and is deliberately short. A link could afford an
    | hour because whoever intercepted it still had to guess nothing; a code is
    | guessable, so it gets spent quickly.
    |
    | `max_attempts` is the real defence. A million possible codes sounds safe
    | until you divide it by the number of tries allowed: at these settings an
    | attacker gets five guesses and then waits out `lockout_minutes`. Raising
    | the code length without lowering this would undo the point.
